A substitution allows any arguments as part of a command to be substituted
by that value, e.g., "original-cmd //some/long/arg1 //some/long/arg2" can
be substituted out with "cmd-alias sub1 sub2" by adding subs for the args.

This will remove the substitution for scopes beneath levels in
the provided key path. A command scope can a tree of sub commands
and substitutions.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// removesubCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// removesubCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
